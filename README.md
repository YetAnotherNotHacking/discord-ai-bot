# What is it?
This is a discord bot that uses Ollama to run a local server that allows a bot to use this script and make requests to a large number of models that are on the Ollama library.

It currently has 3 commands, which can be seen below.

/ask - Uses the selected chatbot to answer a question asked.

/image - Uses Stable Diffusion though SDKit to make an image and sends it with a ping to the user.

/imagine - Uses the selected model to take a prompt and improve it and then send it to Stable diffusion using SDKit, combining the function of /ask and /image

# Requirements
It needs the python packages sdkit, requests, and of course, this Discord package, named discord with pip.
Note that it will only work with Linux and MacOS, atleast until they make a windows version for Ollama, which you will need to be able to use this tool.
